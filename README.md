# UC1 - Lets create a simple Linked List of 56, 30 and 70.

# UC2 - Ability to create Linked List by adding 30 and 56 to 70
- Node with data 70 is First Created
- Next 30 is added to 70
- Finally 56 is added to 30
- LinkedList Sequence: 56->30->70.

# UC3 - Ability to create Linked List by appending 30 and 70 to 56
- Node with data 56 is First Created
- Next Append 30 to 56
- Finally Append 70 to 30
- LinkedList Sequence: 56->30->70

# UC4 - Ability to insert 30 between 56 and 70
- Final Sequence: 56->30->70

# UC5 - Ability to delete the first element in the LinkedList of sequence 56->30->70
- Write pop method
- Note there is new head
- Final Sequence: 30->70

# UC6 - Ability to delete the last element in the LinkedList of sequence 56->30->70
- Write popLast method
- Note there is new tail
- Final Sequence: 56->30

# UC7 - Ability to search LinkedList to find Node with value 30
- Write MSTest Test Case as demonstrated in class
- Loop through LinkedList to find node with key 30

# UC8 - Ability to insert 40 after 30 to the Linked List sequence of 56->30->70
- Write MSTest Test Case as demonstrated in class
- Search LinkedList to get Node with key value 30
- Then Insert 40 to 30
- Final Sequence: 56->30->40->70

# UC9 - Ability to delete 40 from the Linked List sequence of 56->30->40->70 and show the size of LinkedList is 3
- Write MSTest Test Case as demonstrated in class
- Search LinkedList to find node with key value 40
- Delete the node
- Implement size() and show the Linked List size is 3
- Final Sequence: 56->30->70

# UC10 - Ability to create Ordered Linked List in ascending order of data entered in following sequence 56, 30, 40, and 70
- Refactor the code to create SortedLinkedList Class
- Create Node that takes data that is Comparable
- Perform Sorting during the add method call
- Final Sequence: 30->40->56->70
